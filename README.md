# Data-Literacy-WiSe-2024-25---Stadt-Land-Fluss-Optimization

This is the repository for Data Literacy WiSe 2024/2025 Group 12's project: Stadt, Land, Fluss Strategic Word Selection by Word Usage Frequency. 

Our code is in the proc folder. There are a couple SQL queries which were used to connect and filter corpora databases, which have not been uploaded to the repository due to their large file size. We also have an excel file containing the final filtered word list by frequency of letter and category. 

The python notebooks included were used to run the statistical analysis of our games, preprocess our databases, both frequencies and dictionaries, and query Chat GPT to classify a supplemental noun list. 

You can also find some of our more lightweight data sources that did not go over the github file size limit.
